# webkit-editor

This is an experiment in creating a text editor (for computer code) in Safari/WebKit.

**Requires Safari 4 or Chrome**

> Disclaimer: This is just for fun and not meant to be a useful editor.

## Usage

Open `index.html` or <a href="http://hunch.se/webkit-editor/">try it out online</a>.

Or install a <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> server locally so the AJAX parts work.  After node is installed, run <pre>node server.js</pre> and then go to http://localhost:8001/index.html in a browser..

### Disabling Prettify (syntax highlighting)

This thing currently uses [Google Prettify](http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/) for syntax highlighting which is very buggy. You can disable prettify (and thus enable things like undo/redo which breaks with Prettify) by changing the following line in `index.html`:

    <script src="prettify.js"></script>

to:

    <!--script src="prettify.js"></script-->
